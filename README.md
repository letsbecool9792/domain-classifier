Something i had to do for ML Bootcamp Challenge 101


This project aims to build a predictive model using XGBoost to classify and forecast target variables based on top-level domain features. The pipeline involves data preprocessing, label encoding, handling unseen labels, and missing value imputation using scikit-learn tools. The model is trained and evaluated on a labeled dataset, with predictions made on unseen test data. Ideal for understanding domain-based classification tasks and exploring advanced feature handling techniques.

Key Features:
Label encoding with unseen label handling
Missing value imputation with SimpleImputer
XGBoost model for high-performance predictions
Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature alignment
CSV-based test data input and submission output
